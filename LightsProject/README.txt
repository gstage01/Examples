The goal of this project is to control a 10 meter strip of programmable LED lights over a simple HTTP server. The main component of the server is the ESP-01, written in C++. This app is meant to control animations, brightness, sequence colors and features of animations to be developed.

These components are soldered together, with the electrical circuit to be shown here upon completion.
Pictures to be included upon completion.
