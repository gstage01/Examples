# examples
Projects from classes/individual work/jobs that exemplify a good set of work from multiple coding languages. 

Much of my time is spent in a web environment, using NodeJS/ReactJS. With much of my work in these languages being under my previous jobs, those examples could not be released on this Github. 

Of the languages shown in this repo, and described in the above statement, other experience includes:

* MySQL and database structure
* AWS cloud architecture including:
	* S3
	* Elastic Beanstalk
	* RDS
	* IAM
	* Incognito
	* IoT One-Click
	* API Gateway
	* Lambda
* Google Sheets API
