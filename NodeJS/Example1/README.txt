This assignment was done in CSCI 4131 - Internet Programming. The assignment was to create a NodeJS server to serve a webpage with features including: ExpressJS routing, login page with MySQL queries, dynamic table loading from database, sessions and cookies, adding form data to a database. Page loading used templates in Pug. Pictures will be added later, as database systems are hosted on UMN servers.
